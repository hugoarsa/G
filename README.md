Hi! I'm Hugo, an undergraduate from fib that took this course at fall of 2022-2023 

I just wanted to share the work done for the class here for anyone interested.

In this class we use the NewViewer to create shaders of different types and plugins for 
OpenGL, the description of how this software developed by the teachers works is in a
different readme file inside the folder with the same name.

To be completely honest I wasn't the best student in this class, but nevetheless I took it
and passed without probems (enjoy it, it's one of the easier ones in the Computer Science 
mention at FIB). So basically the quality of my code is inversely proportional to the time 
that passed since the beginning. Labs 1 to 5 are good, until the first exam (on which I got 
like a 8.8 or something). The labs from the second exam are a bit less professional and 
not to be trusted a lot (I got like a 6 because plugins where very hard that year). But 
the repositories might be helpful to put in your exam directory to help (they re-use 
activities from other years so ;D )

Best of luck and check the other repositories if you are doing the CS mention at FIB!!
